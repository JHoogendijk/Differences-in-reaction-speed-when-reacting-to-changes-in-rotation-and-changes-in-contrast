                You will now answer several questions regarding your device, age and gender.
                We will use this data to rule out correlations between gender or age and to group data based on the types of monitors.

                <span>Gender:</span><br>

                In the next step you will see images with rectangles on them.<br>
                First the original image will show. Next you will see a white screen. After that a screen with an altered image.<br>
                If you spot the change in the image you will have to press the space bar. <br>
                You will then have to click on the change to verify your answer.<br>
                The step will consist of 10 questions.<br>
                <br>
                Good luck!
